## eeg_image_recall
Implementation of a LSTM model on time series eeg data collected from [NeuroSky headset](https://store.neurosky.com/pages/mindwave). Using this model we try to predict the images recall ability of a user while performing a [forced choice memory test](https://link.springer.com/10.1007%2F978-0-387-79948-3_183). 

The questionnaire for answering the questions on the test was performed using a [Web project](https://github.com/shashvatshah9/Forced-Choice-Memory-Test) specifically for collecting the eeg data.
